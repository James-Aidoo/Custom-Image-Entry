"# Custom-Image-Entry" 
Hello Xamarin Friends , 
Today, I am going to create a custom ImageEntry. 
Whenever we go to create a login page, we can not understand which control is used for the user and password. 
I am create a custom control today to solve this problem. We do not have to write more code from its use and with this
 help the page design will look good too.
 Features of Image Entry controls
1)Accent Color = ( AccentColor="BlueViolet"),
2)Text Property = (Text="Xamarin Skills"),
3)Keyboard Property = (Keyboard="Default"),
4)Placeholder Property = (Placeholder="Xamarin Skills"),
5)IsPassword Property = (IsPassword="False"),
6)Left ImageSource Property = (LImageSource="email"),
7)Right ImageSource Property = (RImageSource="eyeshow"),
8)ImageEntry RightImage = Clicked Property(RightImageClicked="ImageEntry_RightImageClicked"),
9)ImageEntry LeftImage Clicked Property = (LeftImageClicked="ImageEntry_LeftImageClicked"),
10)ImageAlignment Property = (ImageAlignment="Password"),
